  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Imaging data contains a substantial amount of
              information which can be difficult to evaluate by eye. With the
              expansion of high throughput microscopy methodologies producing
              increasingly large datasets, automated and objective analysis of
              the resulting images is essential to effectively extract
              biological information from this data. CellProfiler is a free,
              open source image analysis program which enables researchers to
              generate modular pipelines with which to process microscopy
              images into interpretable measurements. RESULTS: Herein we
              describe CellProfiler 4, a new version of this software with
              expanded functionality. Based on user feedback, we have made
              several user interface refinements to improve the usability of
              the software. We introduced new modules to expand the
              capabilities of the software. We also evaluated performance and
              made targeted optimizations to reduce the time and cost
              associated with running common large-scale analysis pipelines.
              CONCLUSIONS: CellProfiler 4 provides significantly improved
              performance in complex workflows compared to previous versions.
              This release will ensure that researchers will have continued
              access to CellProfiler's powerful computational tools in the
              coming years.",

              works out of the box for end users, through a simple and
              intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and
              adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time,
              3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants.
              TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that
              aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of
              TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily
              customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an
              extensible platform where developers can easily write their own
              detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms
              within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework
              provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and

              including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The
              current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of
              three different biological problems. First, we perform
              Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how
              light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early
              development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the
              lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we
              investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential
              modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the
              cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in
              the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse
              motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for
              quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis

               discriminative deep learning methods that are trained on pairs
               of noisy input and clean target images. Recently it has been
               shown that such methods can also be trained without clean
               targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used,
               in an approach known as Noise2Noise (N2N). Here, we introduce
               Noise2Void (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one
               step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean
               target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on
               the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied
               when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the
               application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of
               training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We
               compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either
               clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available.
               Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that
               have more information available during training. Still, we
               observe that the denoising performance of Noise2Void drops in
               moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising
               methods.",
