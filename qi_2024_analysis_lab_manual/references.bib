  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Imaging data contains a substantial amount of
              information which can be difficult to evaluate by eye. With the
              expansion of high throughput microscopy methodologies producing
              increasingly large datasets, automated and objective analysis of
              the resulting images is essential to effectively extract
              biological information from this data. CellProfiler is a free,
              open source image analysis program which enables researchers to
              generate modular pipelines with which to process microscopy
              images into interpretable measurements. RESULTS: Herein we
              describe CellProfiler 4, a new version of this software with
              expanded functionality. Based on user feedback, we have made
              several user interface refinements to improve the usability of
              the software. We introduced new modules to expand the
              capabilities of the software. We also evaluated performance and
              made targeted optimizations to reduce the time and cost
              associated with running common large-scale analysis pipelines.
              CONCLUSIONS: CellProfiler 4 provides significantly improved
              performance in complex workflows compared to previous versions.
              This release will ensure that researchers will have continued
              access to CellProfiler's powerful computational tools in the
              coming years.",

              works out of the box for end users, through a simple and
              intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and
              adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time,
              3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants.
              TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that
              aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of
              TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily
              customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an
              extensible platform where developers can easily write their own
              detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms
              within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework

              current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of
              three different biological problems. First, we perform

              light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early
              development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the
              lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we
              investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential
              modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the
              cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in
              the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse
              motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for
              quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis

               discriminative deep learning methods that are trained on pairs
               of noisy input and clean target images. Recently it has been
               shown that such methods can also be trained without clean
               targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used,
               in an approach known as Noise2Noise (N2N). Here, we introduce
               Noise2Void (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one
               step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean
               target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on
               the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied
               when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the
               application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of
               training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We
               compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either
               clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available.
               Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that
               have more information available during training. Still, we
               observe that the denoising performance of Noise2Void drops in
               moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising
               methods.",

              manual and automated image segmentation routines that can be
              rapidly applied to single- and multi-channel images as well as to
              timelapse movies in 2D or 3D. LABKIT is specifically designed to
              work efficiently on big image data and enables users of consumer
              laptops to conveniently work with multiple-terabyte images. This
              efficiency is achieved by using ImgLib2 and BigDataViewer as well
              as a memory efficient and fast implementation of the random
              forest based pixel classification algorithm as the foundation of
              our software. Optionally we harness the power of graphics
              processing units (GPU) to gain additional runtime performance.
              LABKIT is easy to install on virtually all laptops and
              workstations. Additionally, LABKIT is compatible with high
              performance computing (HPC) clusters for distributed processing
              of big image data. The ability to use pixel classifiers trained
              in LABKIT via the ImageJ macro language enables our users to
              integrate this functionality as a processing step in automated
              image processing workflows. Finally, LABKIT comes with rich
              online resources such as tutorials and examples that will help
              users to familiarize themselves with available features and how
              to best use LABKIT in a number of practical real-world use-cases.",

  abstract = "The presence of systematic noise in images in high-throughput
              microscopy experiments can significantly impact the accuracy of
              downstream results. Among the most common sources of systematic
              noise is non-homogeneous illumination across the image field.
              This often adds an unacceptable level of noise, obscures true
              quantitative differences and precludes biological experiments
              that rely on accurate fluorescence intensity measurements. In
              this paper, we seek to quantify the improvement in the quality of
              high-content screen readouts due to software-based illumination
              correction. We present a straightforward illumination correction
              pipeline that has been used by our group across many experiments.
              We test the pipeline on real-world high-throughput image sets and
              evaluate the performance of the pipeline at two levels: (a)
              Z'-factor to evaluate the effect of the image correction on a
              univariate readout, representative of a typical high-content
              screen, and (b) classification accuracy on phenotypic signatures
              derived from the images, representative of an experiment
              involving more complex data mining. We find that applying the
              proposed post-hoc correction method improves performance in both
              experiments, even when illumination correction has already been
              applied using software associated with the instrument. To
              facilitate the ready application and future development of
              illumination correction methods, we have made our complete test
              data sets as well as open-source image analysis pipelines
              publicly available. This software-based solution has the
              potential to improve outcomes for a wide-variety of image-based

              techniques into practice. To overcome this, we created Metrics

              problem-aware selection of metrics. Developed by a large
              international consortium in a multistage Delphi process, it is
              based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint-a structured
              representation of the given problem that captures all aspects
              that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest
              to the properties of the target structure(s), dataset and
              algorithm output. On the basis of the problem fingerprint, users

              cognitive biases, combined with institutional pressures that
              reward positive research results, can quickly skew a microscopy

              well-intentioned researchers are susceptible to bias, which must
